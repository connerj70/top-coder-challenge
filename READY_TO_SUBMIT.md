I've fixed the issue with your reimbursement calculation script. The problem was a mismatch between the features your script was creating and the features the prediction models were expecting. 

I resolved this by retraining the models with the current script, ensuring they are now perfectly in sync.

Your `private_results.txt` file has been successfully generated and is now ready for you to submit.

Good luck!
