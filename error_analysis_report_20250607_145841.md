## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Immediate Fixes Required
**Negative reimbursement values** (CRITICAL)
- Count: 3 cases
- Cause: Efficiency penalty calculation in medium-high miles/day range

### Systematic Issues
**Single-day trip calculation failure**
- Evidence: Worst performing duration category with 66.1% average error
- Impact: 20 cases in sample, consistent failure pattern

**Receipt amount scaling problems**
- Evidence: Strong positive correlation (0.510) with overestimation
- Impact: Affects all high-receipt cases, systematic bias

**Efficiency threshold cascade effects**
- Evidence: Sharp error increases at 180 and 220 miles/day thresholds
- Impact: +32.3% error increase and +12.5% negative rate change

## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Fix negative value bug in efficiency penalty calculation**
   - Target: Miles/day range 232.1-344.9 (25% negative rate)
   - Impact: Eliminate 3% of cases producing negative values
   - Implementation: Review and correct efficiency penalty formula in Edge Case 3

2. **Redesign single-day trip calculation logic**
   - Target: Duration 1.0-2.4 days (56.9% avg error)
   - Impact: Improve accuracy for 31% of test cases
   - Implementation: Create specialized single-day trip handling in Edge Case 1

3. **Fix threshold cascade at 220 miles/day**
   - Target: Miles/day threshold causing +12.5% negative rate jump
   - Impact: Reduce negative value risk for medium-high efficiency trips
   - Implementation: Smooth transition logic around efficiency thresholds

### Short-term Improvements
4. **Adjust receipt scaling for high amounts**
   - Target: Receipts >$300/day (30.5% error increase)
   - Impact: Reduce systematic overestimation for high-spend trips

5. **Rebalance duration-based biases**
   - Target: 10+ day trips (70% overestimate rate)
   - Impact: Eliminate systematic overestimation for extended trips

6. **Optimize efficiency sweet spot logic**
   - Target: 180-220 miles/day range performing worse than expected
   - Impact: Improve accuracy for supposedly optimal efficiency range
