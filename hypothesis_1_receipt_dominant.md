# Hypothesis 1: Receipt-Dominant Linear Model

**Date:** June 2025  
**Priority:** Primary hypothesis based on strongest correlation (0.704)  
**Expected Accuracy:** 70-80%

## Mathematical Model

### Core Formula
```
Reimbursement = BaseRate(duration) + ReceiptMultiplier × Receipts + EfficiencyAdjustment(miles/day)
```

### Component Definitions

#### 1. BaseRate(duration)
Based on analysis showing decreasing per-day rates:
- 1 day: $800-900 base
- 2 days: $400-500 base  
- 3+ days: Diminishing base rate

**Formula:**
```
BaseRate(duration) = max(900 - (duration - 1) × 200, 100)
```

#### 2. ReceiptMultiplier  
Primary factor with correlation 0.704
**Formula:**
```
ReceiptMultiplier = 0.75
```

#### 3. EfficiencyAdjustment(miles/day)
Penalty for high efficiency (negative correlation -0.142)
**Formula:**
```
EfficiencyAdjustment = -max(0, (miles/day - 50) × 0.5)
```

### Complete Model
```python
def calculate_reimbursement_hypothesis1(duration, miles, receipts):
    base_rate = max(900 - (duration - 1) * 200, 100)
    receipt_component = receipts * 0.75
    miles_per_day = miles / duration
    efficiency_penalty = -max(0, (miles_per_day - 50) * 0.5)
    
    return base_rate + receipt_component + efficiency_penalty
```

### Performance Analysis
- **Accurate Predictions (±25% error):** 4 out of 15 cases (26.7%)
- **Major Errors (>50% error):** 8 out of 15 cases (53.3%)
- **Average Absolute Error:** 445.5%

## Issues Identified

### 1. Base Rate Problem
The model significantly overestimates short trips and underestimates long trips, suggesting:
- Base rate is too high for 1-day trips
- Model doesn't account for receipt-dependency properly

### 2. Efficiency Penalty Insufficient
High-efficiency cases (F, G, K) show massive underestimation, indicating:
- Efficiency penalty is too weak
- May need different penalty structure

### 3. Receipt Scaling Issues  
Cases with high receipts (I, J, L, N) show mixed results, suggesting:
- Receipt multiplier may not be constant
- Possible threshold effects or caps

## Model Refinements Needed

### Refinement 1: Adjust Base Rate Structure
```python
# Reduce base rate significantly
base_rate = max(100 - (duration - 1) * 10, 50)
```

### Refinement 2: Increase Receipt Dominance
```python
# Make receipts more dominant
receipt_component = receipts * 1.0  # or higher
```

### Refinement 3: Stronger Efficiency Penalty
```python
# More aggressive efficiency penalty
efficiency_penalty = -max(0, (miles_per_day - 30) * 2.0)
```

### Refinement 4: Add Receipt Thresholds
```python
# Different multipliers for different receipt ranges
if receipts < 500:
    receipt_multiplier = 0.6
elif receipts < 1000:
    receipt_multiplier = 0.8
else:
    receipt_multiplier = 0.9
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test refined parameters** against sample cases
2. **Compare with alternative hypotheses** (tiered, conditional models)
3. **Analyze failure patterns** to identify missing components
4. **Consider hybrid approaches** combining receipt dominance with thresholds

## Confidence Assessment

- **Model Direction:** High confidence (receipts are clearly primary)
- **Parameter Values:** Low confidence (initial estimates need refinement)
- **Base Structure:** Medium confidence (linear combination appropriate)

The hypothesis confirms receipt dominance but requires significant parameter adjustment to achieve acceptable accuracy. The linear structure appears sound, but values need calibration against actual data patterns.
